  <p>Hello World!</p>
  <a>What is existence? What is life?</a>
  <a>Hello! I am Muzan. You might be wondering what this place is and why it is. At first, let me tell you about the beginning, the moment when there was nothing, like actually nothing. "Where was I before I was born?" if you ask, the answer would probably go "You weren't." That is the kind of "nothing" that we're talking about here. And boom, a black, or I suppose, a white void. This is a creation, a world that didn't exist but now it does. A place where every possible concept can come to life. A blank canvas.</a>
