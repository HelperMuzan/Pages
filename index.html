  <p>Hello World!</p>
  <a>What is existence? What is life? What is creation? What is soul? Can lies be told or is it just truth waiting to unfold? These are some thoughts I ponder every once in a while. Thinking about everything and nothing. Is life a story to write or a story to tell? Or is it even what one thinks it is? Are we just part of a blank canvas? Is this place a blank canvas as well? Interesting things and thinks these are, question probably good if left unanswered, though that will not prevent me form answering them anyway. Hello, I am Muzan. Allow me to explain everything to you as I can see a spark of interest in your eyes.</a>
  
  <p>The Beginning</p>
  <a>You might be wondering what this place is and why it is. At first, let me tell you about the beginning, the moment when there was nothing, like actually nothing. "Where was I before I was born?" if you ask, the answer would probably go "You weren't." That is the kind of "nothing" that we're talking about here. And boom, a black, or I suppose, a white void. This is a creation, a world that didn't exist but now it does. A place where every possible concept can come to life. A blank canvas for one might call it.</a>
